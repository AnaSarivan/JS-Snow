# JS-Snow

Snow Animation Project
This project creates a delightful snow effect using JavaScript. It brings falling snowflakes to your web page, perfect for adding a winter or holiday spirit touch.

What It Does
The Flake class is at the heart of this animation. It takes care of everything, from making each snowflake appear on the screen to letting it gracefully fall and eventually disappear. This animation can be a lovely addition to your website, adding a cozy and festive vibe.

Key Features
Unique Snowflakes: Each snowflake has its size, speed, and starting point, making the snowfall look natural and varied.

Smooth Falling: The snowflakes gently drift from the top of the screen, mimicking real snow.
Natural Disappearance: When a snowflake reaches the bottom of the screen, it gracefully vanishes, making space for new snowflakes to fall.

The Flake Class
The Flake class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a snowflake. Here is a breakdown of its methods:

Constructor: constructor(n, left, top, speed, size)
Initializes a new snowflake instance with specific properties:

n: A unique identifier for the snowflake.
left: The horizontal position where the snowflake starts.
top: The vertical position where the snowflake starts.
speed: The speed at which the snowflake falls.
size: The size of the snowflake, affecting its scale.
Method: fall(cw, ch, cb)
Starts the falling motion of the snowflake. The parameters are:

cw: The width of the container.
ch: The height of the container (usually the height of the screen or viewport).
cb: A callback function to handle the disappearance of the snowflake once it reaches the bottom.
Method: disappear(cb)
Stops the snowflake's movement and hides it from view. The callback function cb can be used to trigger additional actions upon disappearance.

Method: update()
Updates the position of the snowflake on the screen based on its current properties.

Method: render(root)
Renders the snowflake as an HTML element within the specified root container. The snowflake is represented by a div element with a class of flake and styles applied for positioning and scaling.
